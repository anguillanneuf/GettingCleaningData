# GettingCleaningData
This repo was created for the course project in the Coursera course on Getting and Cleaning Data. 
There are three files in this repo. 

1. README.md is the file you are reading now and describes the contents of the repo.

2. run_analysis.R has all the codes required to complete the assignment*. "dplyr" is a required package for running the codes correctly. And the working directory should be set to where the UCI HAR Dataset file is located. 

- Merging the training and test sets; extracting mean and standard deviation for each measurement; naming activities; naming variables; summarizing variables by subject and activity. 

3. CodeBook.md describes the tidy dataset at the end of the assignment.
